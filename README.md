DESCRIPTION
--------------------------
NeOGen (genetic Ne for Overlapping Generations analysis; pronounced Neo-gen) is point-&-click genetic effective population size (Ne) and demographic modelling software. The software, initially designed for sharks, is applicable to many overlapping-generation species with moderate to low population sizes and fecundity (such as mammals). NeOGen provides a cohesive linkage disequilibrium genetic Ne estimate (Ne.LD) analysis and population simulation framework that simulates both the demography and genetic composition of a population, given a small subset of fundamental species-specific life-history, demographic and genetic priors.  NeOGen then guides the researchers in-silico to establish a tractable sampling regime, resulting in the numbers of samples and loci required to give accurate and precise Ne.LD estimates when empirical sampling is performed in the field.

MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
Minimum 4GB RAM
Approximately 1 GB free hard disk space for the application

SOFWARE REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------
Microsoft Windows OS 64-bit Only (Sorry Linux & Apple users.  Hopefully we can port to your OS's in the next versions)
Microsoft Windows 7, 8.1, & 10
Mouse or compatible pointing device.
User-specified PDF-viewer (e.g. Adobe Acrobat or equivalent)
Best viewed at Screen resolution of 1280x768
Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package - This is typically already installed on many Windows machines, if it isn’t the NeOGen Setup will attempt to install it. 

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
1. Download Setup EXE file
2. Double-click Setup EXE to start installation
3. Specify the installation folder. The defaults folder is recommended. Do NOT use a windows system reserved folder e.g. C:\Windows\Program Files, as security permissions may prevent NeOGen operation.
4. Follow the prompts to finalise the installation. Use the default values for best results.
5. Double-click the NeOGen-Power shortcut (on the desktop, in the start menu, or in the install folder) to start NeOGen.  Don’t start it with the NOGP.exe.
6. You're done! Start exploring the wonder of NeOGen. Reading the guides will help ;o). The user manual (i.e. help file, guide 0) is displayed alongside the main app when its launched.

UNINSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------
Uninstall NeOGen from the Windows Programs & Features Control Panel screen by clicking on the NeOGen entry.
Alternatively, clicking on the unins000.exe in the installation folder will start the uninstall process.
